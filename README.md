# Welcome to my Github profile!

## Here are the highlights of what I've been working on recently:

### 💻 CodeInsight Extension [Java, React] https://github.com/campbellbartlett/code-insight-extension
A plugin for Atlassian BitBucket Server that adds administrator override when status checks fail during a PR (similar to how it works with GitHub PRs).
Still actively making changes with more features to come in the future.

### 🛒 TrolleySpace [React, Serverless (Firebase)] https://github.com/campbellbartlett/trolleyspace.net
A website I have been developing over the last 6 months for managing your household Grocery Lists and (work in progress) meal plans + recipes. Real time updates for multiple users and works offline (for when you hit that annoying spot in the Supermarket with no phone signal!).

### 🏏 Live-Cricketscores.com [Angular] https://github.com/campbellbartlett/live-cricketscores.com
My cricket scores website - shows live cricket scores from around the globe for all international matches (Test, ODI, T20) and many other leagues where data is availble (IPL, BBL, Marsh Series etc). Displays ball by ball commentary when available.
